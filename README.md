# Team_11_9Hacks2.0 - Queminators
## Queue infobot
### Aim:
* Read the number of persons in a given area
* Send that data to users in real time
* Initial use case: 
The main mess in the SRMAP campus faces the issue of overcrowding, and there we face the annoying queues at the food counter. To counter this issue, we came up with this whatsapp chatbot. This chatbot allows the user top ask for a real time status of the food queue [i.e. the number of people already standing in the queue for food]. This enables the user to take a decision to either go now or later to get food according to your tolerability and stuff.

# Near Future Scope:
* Have interactive options in the chatbot
* Give daily reminder for having food
* Also have a dynamic menu for each day
